        <h1> My Favorite Hobby </h1>
        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p> I am Saumya Jha, 12 years old and in 7th grade. My hobby is to draw. It is an another world which I love to explore, a world sometimes with white and black sketches or with colourfull paintings. It brings the creativity out of me. I like to sketch more then paint. Sketches show you a classic world of black and white.Few of my up-to-date made skecthes are of nature while the rest are of humans.My paitings sometimes depict seneries while the rest show a world of gradient colours. In this pandemic,we children have hardly something to do. So most of us just surf online. I sometimes find few ideas for sketches in youtube, then i mix them up to make a new one.If I am out of ideas, then I simply go on google and search for pictures of nature, and trust me, you will love many of them. Nature is just so beutiful and vast! Well this is only one of my hobbies, I also like to cook, design, dance and code! And belive me, once you try these activities, you are hardly going to get bored.
